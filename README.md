# 🧠 EduAgent — AI Assistant for Schools on Solana  
**Pilot Integration: Intebix ↔ Eurasian Bank | Digital Tenge (KZTE) | NFT Achievements | AI Gamification**

---

## 🌍 Overview
EduAgent isn’t just software — it’s a mission to make education more transparent, accessible, and inspiring through **AI** and **Solana blockchain**.  
We automate communication, attendance tracking, and tuition payments for schools, while motivating students with **NFT achievements** and **AI-guided goals**.  

The project builds on the **pilot integration between Intebix and Eurasian Bank**, exploring real-world payment flows using **Digital Tenge (KZTE)** and **USDC**.  
EduAgent shows how Kazakhstan’s digital currency initiative can empower schools, parents, and students with trust and transparency.

## 🧩 Problem & Vision
Kazakhstan is pioneering one of the world’s first **Digital Tenge pilots**, yet most schools still operate offline — manual payments, paper reports, and low student motivation.  
EduAgent connects this national fintech innovation with the education sector, creating a digital ecosystem where payments, communication, and achievements live on-chain.
